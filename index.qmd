:::{#me}
My name is Mercy Ogbede, and I am originally from Imo State, Nigeria. My academic background is in education with a major in Government, where I developed an early interest in how information shapes public understanding and policy. I am now a graduate student in the Data Analytics & Computational Social Science (DACSS) program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
In my studies, I focus on transforming complex datasets into meaningful insights through statistical modeling, visualization, and data-driven storytelling.

## Goals
As a developing data analyst, my goal is to transform complex datasets into clear insights that support meaningful decision-making. I am particularly focused on strengthening my ability to communicate analytical results through effective data-driven storytelling, making statistical patterns understandable to both technical and non-technical audiences. I aim to continue improving my skills in modeling, visualization, and interpretation so that I can bridge the gap between data and real-world understanding, ultimately producing analyses that are not only accurate but also compelling, accessible, and useful.
